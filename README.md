# Arthur's Portfolio
My portfolio of personal achievements and completed or ongoing projects from Grade 9 until the current days.
## Introduction
Hello! My name is Arthur, I am a current Grade 12 brazilian student applying to undergraduate programs deeply interested in engineering and computer science and will graduate by the end of 2024. In this portfolio, I will briefly discuss about my skills, projects and achievements throughout my high school life. This file is constantly being updated (especially as my coding skills improve). 
## Exchange Program in Canada
During my junior year in high school, from September 2023 to June 2024, I participated in an exchange program in Canada, where I had the opportunity to engage into new academic, personal and cultural experiences which changed me forever, including AP courses, learning a new instrument and engaging in intercultural events.
### AP Courses Taken
1. **AP Calculus BC**
   - **Description**: With this course, I have engaged, for the first time, in differential and integral calculus, including limits, derivatives, integrals, polar functions, Taylor Series and others.
   - **Skills Acquired**: Calculus was the main course that opened my mind with problem-solving abilities and capacity of interdisciplinary asssociating other fields to mathematics (such as the entirety of mechanics, kinetics, populational growth and decay etc), besides of the enhancement of previous mathematical skills.
2. **AP Chemistry**
   - **Description**: Chemistry was a heavy-loaded course that explored the basic fundamentals of chemistry, including thermodynamics, kinetics, equilibrium, acids and bases etc, with the inclusion of lab expiriments.
   - **Skills Acquired**: Besides from chemical knowledge and even more problem-solving skills and data analysis, chemistry mainly introduced me to the creation of scientific articles which can be used for any research in the future and team-work abilities, as all of the labs were done by groups of four.
   - **Lab Example**: [Titration Lab](https://1drv.ms/w/c/5db393d852abcec5/EeawYwmcLzpHn8SBJJsogjEBEEPzZwlX9_4v7KL9vlQvaA?e=1BZ0WQ): This lab had the purpose of titrating NaOH in a solution of two different acidic compounds to determine their concentrations and mass percentage in the solution.
 3. **AP Physics C: Mechanics**
    - **Description**: This semester-long course explored newtonian mechanics, including the concepts of kinematics, dynamics, energy, momentum, rotation, oscillations and gravitation, all using calculus concepts, such as derivatives, integrals and differential equations, often applicating physics concepts in real life situations.
    - **Skills Acquired**: Mechanics allowed me to see physics in a brand new way, enhancing my calculus skills and also helping severely with teamwork, as my fellow classmates often helped me and were helped with more demanding questions.
4. **AP Physics C: Electricity & Magnetism**
    - **Description**: Followed by mechanics, this semester-long course also required calculus knowledge, even more than the previous one, exploring the fields of eletrostatics, circuits, magnetism and eletromagnetism.
    - **Skills Acquired**: Similarly to Mechanics, as calculus was severely used and applied in real life situations, mathematical skills were enhanced and teamwork abilities got significantly better.
5. **AP European History**
    - **Description**: This course came as an idea throughout the beginning of the second semester, by me and a friend, who wanted to challenge ourselves with an advanced humanities course while also taking all the other STEM advanced classes. Being tutored by our teacher individually, not only we explored concepts of european history from the period of the renaissance to modern ages but also learned about the historical thinking skills of comparasion, document analysis, continuity and change over time, contextualization and causation, required for the two essays required in the exam.
    - **Skills Acquired**: Besides from the skills previously mentioned, this course allowed me to see the world and its problems through a new historical perspective, enhanced strongly my writing and interpretative skills in a second language, deeply expanding my vocabulary and overall knowledge.
### Other Projects
1. **Learning a New Instrument**
   - When I was a child, it has always been my dream to play the  electric guitar, and the exchange allowed me not only to fulfill my dream but take it to a whole new manner. Picking up the instrument for the first time when arriving and doing weekly classes allowed me to interact with a whole community of musicians in my community, as I was encouraged to and did indeed join the Jam Club in my high school. From practicing daily and playing with other musicians and hearing a lecture from Dan Mangan, close to the end of the exchange year, I played in a three-member band in what is called the "Evening of the Arts" in front of a real audience, enhancing even more my love with the instrument. I will definitely keep pursuing classes and activites through my senior year and the rest of my life.
