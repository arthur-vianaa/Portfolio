# Arthur's Portfolio
My portfolio of personal achievements and completed or ongoing projects.
## Introduction
Hello! My name is Arthur, current Grade 12 brazilian student applying to undergraduate programs deeply interested in engineering and computer science who will graduate by the end of 2024.
## Exchange Program in Canada
During my junior year in high school, I participated in an exchange program in Canada, where I had the opportunity to engage into new academical, personal and cultural experiences which changed me forever, including AP courses, learning a new instrument and engaging in intercultural events.
### AP Courses Taken
1. **AP Calculus BC**
   - **Description**: With this course, I have engaged, for the first time, in differential and integral calculus, including limits, derivatives, integrals, polar functions, Taylor Series and others.
   - **Skills Acquired**: Calculus was the main course that opened my mind with problem-solving abilities, capacity of interdisciplinary asssociating other fields to mathematics (such as the entirety of mechanics, kinetics, populational growth and decay etc), besides of the enhancement of previous mathematical skills.
2. **AP Chemistry**
   - **Description**: Chemistry was a heavy-loaded course that explored the basic fundamentals of chemistry, including thermodynamics, kinetics, equilibrium, acids and bases etc, with the inclusion of lab expiriments.
   - **Skills Acquired**: Besides from chemical knowledge and even more problem-solving skills and graphical analysis, chemistry mainly introduced me to the creation of scientific articles which can be used for any research in the future and team-work abilities, as all of the labs were done by groups of four.
   - **Lab Example**: [Titration Lab](https://1drv.ms/w/c/5db393d852abcec5/EeawYwmcLzpHn8SBJJsogjEBEEPzZwlX9_4v7KL9vlQvaA?e=1BZ0WQ)
 3. **AP Physics C: Mechanics**
